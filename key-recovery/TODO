* Add constraint loading to KDE by client
* Application enclave hardcoded constraints for KDE should be hash constraints
* Remove key response routing hint and just use mail + deserialisation; we can't really remove key request hint, because
host is routing the message
* Implement http polling, because now demo is glued using Thread.sleep in 2 places ;)
* Reuse HKDF from Noise library in Conclave to generate keys on Key Derivation Enclave
* Sample doesn't work on MAC because script assumes that module is named "enclave", probably there can't be 2 modules with
enclaves
