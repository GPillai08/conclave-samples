Using this sample will see how Conclave (based on Intel SGX) can be a new tool to solve the private set intersection problem (PSI)
        
# What is Private Set Intersection (PSI)Â ?

PSI refers to the problem of determining the common elements from the intersection of two sets without leaking or disclosing any 
additional information of the remaining elements of the either sets.

# Use case : measuring ad conversion rates

Measuring ad conversion rates is done by comparing the list of people who have seen an ad with those who have completed a transaction. 
These lists are held by the advertiser (say, Google or Facebook), and by merchants, respectively. 
It is often possible to identify users on both ends, using identifiers such as credit card numbers, email addresses, etc. 
A simple solution, which ignores privacy, is for one side to disclose its list of customers to the other side, which then computes the necessary statistics. 

## Parties involved in the sample
Merchant, Service Provider, Host.

Merchant - a Merchant who has a list of users who have purchased their product.  
Service Provider - Service Provider like Facebook, Google who publishes ads on its website.

Merchant wants to calculate the ad conversion rate. Client1 usually tends to share the list of converted user details to Client2.
Service Provider has list of users who has clicked on the ad. Service Provider performs an intersection of these lists on its side to check which 
converted users had clicked the ad.

For simplicity, in this sample clients pass in following data to enclave - 
Merchant - Merchant passes credit card numbers of all users who have made a purchase.
Service Provider - Service Provider passes credit card numbers of all users who have clicked the ad.

## How to run on a non-linux based system

Start the host on a non-Linux system, which will build the enclave and host:

    ./container-gradle host:run

On your terminal, once the host starts, pass in the credit card numbers via Merchant terminal

    /path-to-sdk/scripts/container-gradle client:run --args="MERCHANT 1123 4456 777998 88988898"

On your terminal, start Service Provider and pass in the credit card numbers of users who have clicked the ad

    /path-to-sdk/scripts/container-gradle client:run --args="SERVICE-PROVIDER 88988898 77879 00989"

Once both the clients pass in the credit card numbers, the host calculates the ad conversion rate within the enclave and sends it to both the clients.

## How to run on a linux based system

Start the host on a non-Linux system, which will build the enclave and host:

    ./gradlew host:run

On your terminal, once the host starts, pass in the credit card numbers via Merchant terminal

    ./gradlew client:run --args="MERCHANT 1123 4456 777998 88988898"

On your terminal, start Service Provider and pass in the credit card numbers of users who have clicked the ad

    ./gradlew client:run --args="SERVICE-PROVIDER 88988898 77879 00989"

Once both the clients pass in the credit card numbers, the host calculates the ad conversion rate within the enclave and sends it to both the clients.
